# CFG-Python-kickstarter-project--PokeTrumps
## My first Python Project! ðŸ¤“

Ths project was made with a partner for a Code First Girls Python Kickstarter course sponsored by Deloitte.
The project is a top trumps style text-based game that uses the pokemon API, https://pokeapi.co.

The game can:
- draw random Pokemon from the API along with their stats and images, which appear collated in pop-up photo-viewer window,
- download and play music from https://downloads.khinsider.com/
- record user wins and award badges for progress
- log the Pokemon seen thoughout the game for a "Who's that Pokemon" minigame at the end of the session, in which the game will turn the Pokemon PNGs into a silhouete

ðŸ¥‡	This project awarded us special commendation for being voted the best on the course:  ðŸ¥‡
